# Taxi-app
1) Design a Call taxi booking application -There are n number of taxi’s. For simplicity, assume 4. But it should work for any number of taxi’s. 
-The are 6 points(A,B,C,D,E,F) 
-All the points are in a straight line, and each point is 15kms away from the adjacent points. 
-It takes 60 mins to travel from one point to another 
-Each taxi charges Rs.100 minimum for the first 5 kilometers and Rs.10 for the subsequent kilometers. 
-For simplicity, time can be entered as absolute time. Eg: 9hrs, 15hrs etc. 
-All taxi’s are initially stationed at A. 
-When a customer books a Taxi, a free taxi at that point is allocated 
-If no free taxi is available at that point, a free taxi at the nearest point is allocated. 
-If two taxi’s are free at the same point, one with lower earning is allocated 
-Note that the taxi only charges the customer from the pickup point to the drop point. 
Not the distance it travels from an adjacent point to pickup the customer. 
-If no taxi is free at that time, booking is rejected Design modules for
It should work for any input that they give.
